\description{
Compute Classification Counts and Make Venn Diagram.
}
\usage{
vennCounts(x, include="both")
vennDiagram(object, include="both", names=NULL, mar=rep(1,4), cex=c(1.5,1,0.7), lwd=1,
            circle.col=NULL, counts.col=NULL, show.include=NULL, \dots)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{numeric matrix of 0's and 1's indicating significance of a test.
  Usually created by \code{\link{decideTests}}.}
  \item{object}{either a \code{TestResults} matrix from \code{decideTests} or a \code{VennCounts} object produced by \code{vennCounts}.}
  \item{include}{character vector specifying whether all differentially expressed genes should be counted, or whether the counts should be restricted to genes changing in a certain direction.  Choices are \code{"both"} for all differentially expressed genes, \code{"up"} for up-regulated genes only or \code{"down"} for down-regulated genes only. If \code{include=c("up","down")} then both the up and down counts will be shown. This argument is ignored if \code{object} if \code{object} is already a \code{vennCounts} object.}
  \item{names}{character vector giving names for the sets or contrasts}
  \item{mar}{numeric vector of length 4 specifying the width of the margins around the plot. This argument is passed to \code{par}.}
  \item{cex}{numerical vector of length 3 giving scaling factors for large, medium and small text on the plot.}
  \item{lwd}{numerical value giving the amount by which the circles should be scaled on the plot. See \code{par}.}
  \item{circle.col}{vector of color specifications defining the colors by which the circles should be drawn. See \code{par}.}
  \item{counts.col}{vector of color specifications, of same length as \code{include}, defining the colors by which the counts should be drawn. See \code{par}.}
  \item{show.include}{logical value whether the value of \code{include} should be printed on the plot. Defaults to \code{FALSE} if \code{include} is a single value and \code{TRUE} otherwise}
  \item{\dots}{any other arguments are passed to \code{plot}}
}

\details{
\code{vennDiagram} can plot up to five sets.
\code{vennCounts} can collate intersection counts for any number of sets.
}

\value{
\code{vennCounts} produces a \code{VennCounts} object, which is a numeric matrix with last column \code{"Counts"} giving counts for each possible vector outcome.
\code{vennDiagram} causes a plot to be produced on the current graphical device.
